# Overview

This _octave_ script is used to help shapefiles conversion into the UV3 format. The script applies on the _CSV/WKT_ export from shapefiles to extract the geometry and to export them into a chosen _UV3_ file.

The script also comes with a standard color palette that can be used to assign colors to the desired extracted layers.
